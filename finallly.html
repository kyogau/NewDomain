<title> Watch my progression</title>
<p>   Growing up I wanted to become a police officer. That quickly changed after realizing that I have a love for money and the police officer route wouldn’t lead me to riches and fortune. I never liked art much until I entered college, taking my first art class at BMCC. After this class I gained a new experience in which I learned to view art from different perspectives. I was amazed by the techniques painters from different eras used to create images that are moving until tis day. I once had love for video games when I was growing up. Sadly my parents wanted me to be outside and play which made me lose interest in video games as a whole. From this class I hope to gain practical skills in production, while also enjoying the process</p>
